# 🎭 Batsu-Remix

This is what happens when you **want that minimalist WM look**...  
but can’t commit to 500 lines of `config` and Lua sorcery 😅  
(**Spoiler:** I still ended up editing config files anyway.)

Persona 2 duology is one of my favorite games so I just took the colors from the two wallpapers related to that game and created my own color scheme called **Batsu-Remix** and riced my desktop according to it.
Looks like a window manager, behaves like a DE.  
Perfect for lazy perfectionists™.

> Also so I don't live in terminal that much so instead of going for riced nvim I've found a suckless nvim lua script that doesn't use plugins.   
> It's created by [TheRadLectures](https://github.com/radleylewis/nvim-lite) (his youtube's channel name).
> *It's basically a sleeper build nvim (that's the only way I can put it)*

> The repo is fully browsable and unpacked, a tarball is also available.

## Credits

This setup blends awesome community work, customized for my workflow.

**Colorscheme**  
Batsu Earth and BatsuRedux combine colors extracted from my wallpapers with [Dark Obsidian II](https://www.pling.com/p/1001631/) and [Vulpinity](https://store.kde.org/p/1972609/) (for BatsuRedux).

**Oh-My-Posh**  
Modified from the [stelbent-minimal](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/blob/main/themes/stelbent.minimal.omp.json) theme.

**Yazi**  
Based on the structure of [Eldritch](https://github.com/6ruby1/eldritch.yazi), with replaced Unicode symbols and my custom color palette.

**Wallpapers** (doing the heavy lifting)

- [Homescreen](https://artofkazumakaneko.tumblr.com/post/105016174908/wafflesmccoy-xelo-tath-very-awesomely-sent-me) 
- [SDDM](https://wallpaperaccess.com/download/persona-2-115444)
- [Fetch art](https://www.creativeuncut.com/gallery-12/art/p2-misc1.jpg)
    
**SDDM**  
Removed greeting and repositioned elements from [Sequoia](https://codeberg.org/minMelody/sddm-sequoia)—looks flawless after testing.
